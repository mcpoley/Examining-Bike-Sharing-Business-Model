## Overview of the analysis: 
Citibike is a popular bike-share business in New York City. To explore program opportunities with bike-sharing in Des Moines, IA, one needs to examine the trends already existing with the NYC program. Key factors in this analysis will include an account for the number of bikes registered within specified timeframes, gender differentiations, consumer type, and trip-durations. Such insight will reveal areas of growth, partly in regard to market strategy, and most appropriate bike repair times. 

## Results: A summary of the results can be found here [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/blake2633#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)

## Summary: Advice for investors of this start-up bike sharing business is as follows considering the results of the study:

• Be sure to perform maintenance on the bikes between the hours of 3:00am and 4:00am, when there are the least amount of riders in route.

• In a highly populated city such as NYC, bikes do not seem to be used for a long period of time as infrastructure and destinations are in close proximity. This will need to be  recalibrated for a less populated, more rural area such as routes around Des Moines, Iowa.

• Wednesday seems to be a less populated day of the week. This could be a good opportunity for maintenance and repair.

• Because there are generally more male than female bikers, this needs to be taken into consideration when purchasing equipment. Male gear and bikes run slightly differently from those of females. 

• The later part of the week (Thursday and Friday) are very popular with subscribers. This will take up potential slots for customers to make marginal purchases. A good business model should take into account this potential opportunity cost.

• Another important visual might be a relationship between birth year and gender or birth year and bikeid. This might shed light on type of equipment needed or types of bike trails to incorporate.
